<h2>Mockups</h2><p>We use three types of mockups. Product mockups advertise our products. Promotion mockups are used to inform customers about our special offers. Image mockups are supposed to attract attention to our company activities: opening, recruiting, etc.</p><h4>General design principles</h4><p>When designing mockups we follow a set of rules or — as we call them — principles. They differ from category to category but there are general requirements to follow:</p><p>— When making mockups we stick to a specific set of mandatory features: orange color, brand icons, fonts, and a set of grid templates.</p><p>— We prefer light design that is free from excessive details and is easy to comprehend.</p><p>— We use emotional but simple and understandable language.</p><p>— We make photos and drawings that have an idea behind and we love when they are humorous and crazy.</p><p>— We make mockups with a fixed set of icons and fonts.</p><h3>Brand mockups</h3><p>Brand mockups promote the entire brand, not a specific product.</p><p>Such mockups include federal campaign mockups, posters in stores, and recruitment promotion.</p><p>— We stand out by using orange background on color photos and highlighted orange details on black and white pictures.</p><p>— We come up with creative but simple slogans.</p><p>— Our images express emotions and match the slogan idea.</p><div class="wide"><img src="/images/tmp/%D0%98%D0%BC%D0%B8%D0%B4%D0%B6%D0%B5%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5-%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%BA%D0%B5%D1%82%D1%8B.jpg" alt="Имиджевые макеты" /></div><h3>Product marketing</h3><p>To make things easier we split the products into three categories.</p><h4>A-list products</h4><p>They include seasonal pizzas and revolutional products.</p><p>How we promote them:</p><p>— The mockups emphasize the product taste and quality. </p><p>— The product name gives a hint on what taste you should expect.</p><p>— The images depict the product in a way that makes your mouth water.</p><p>— We always include an amusing detail to the image like a pizza cut into slices which form a pacifism sign.</p><p>— We come up with unique lettering which matches the title of the mockup.</p><p>— We do immersive marketing which provides solutions for a number of channels: from social media to the store front and interior.</p><p>— We also love to break our own rules to ensure WOW promotion. </p><div class="wide"><img src="/images/tmp/%D0%9F%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B4%D1%83%D0%BA%D1%82%D1%8B-%D0%90.jpg" alt="Продукты а" /></div><h4>B-list products</h4><p>This category unites updated pizza recipes, new sides, and drinks.   </p><p>How we promote them:</p><p>— Mockups are based on templates but we bend this rule at times.</p><p>— We prefer clear bright colors which do not distract from the product.</p><p>— Taste and quality are illustrated by simple but delicious-looking photos.</p><p>— The product name is done in the same font style as the title. Sometimes we come up with a simple lettering like on the mockup with the ice cream.</p><div class="wide"><img src="/images/tmp/%D0%9F%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B4%D1%83%D0%BA%D1%82%D1%8B-B.jpg" alt="Продукты b" /></div><h4>C-list products</h4><p>This category combines products on trial. After a successful trial we produce new mockups with the A or B-list approach.</p><p>How we promote them:</p><p>— The mockups are based on templates only.</p><p>— The product name is done in the same font style as the title. No lettering.</p><p>— We use photos only from the catalog.</p><p>— The colors are selected from the list of additional colors in accordance to the product ingredients.</p><div class="wide"><img src="/images/tmp/%D0%9F%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B4%D1%83%D0%BA%D1%82%D1%8B-C.jpg" alt="Продукты c" /></div><h3>Promotion mockups</h3><p>We have two types of promotion mockups:</p><p>— Combo.</p><p>— Promotions.</p><p>All promotion mockups are based on templates with a fixed set of icons and fonts. The sizes of the elements are preset and don’t need to be adapted to a format. It’s a kind of UI kit for advertising mockups.</p><h4>Combo</h4><p>How we promote them:</p><p>— We use templates only.</p><p>— The mockups look alike.</p><p>— We come up with a clear and simple title, which explains the customer’s benefit.</p><p>— We present the “getting more by spending less” idea through the amount of items or purchase situation.</p><p>— We emphasise the product quality through realistic and delicious-looking pictures.</p><p>— We use orange as the main colour but vary textures to distinguish between different campaigns. </p><p>— We use other colors rather than orange when we know that the flyer (or any other similar media) will advertise different promotions on its two sides.</p><div class="wide"><img src="/images/tmp/%D0%9A%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B1%D0%BE-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B6%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5.jpg" alt="Комбо предложение" /></div><h4>Promotions</h4><p>How we promote them:</p><p>— We use templates only.</p><p>— The mockups look alike.</p><p>— We come up with a clear and simple title, which explains the customer’s benefit.</p><p>— We emphasise the product quality through realistic and delicious-looking pictures.</p><p>— We use orange as the main colour but vary textures to distinguish between different campaigns.</p><p>— We use other colors rather than orange when we know that the flyer (or any other similar media) will advertise different promotions on its two sides.</p><div class="wide"><img src="/images/tmp/%D0%90%D0%BA%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5-%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%BA%D0%B5%D1%82%D1%8B.jpg" alt="Акционные макеты" /></div><div class="article-footer"><div class="links"><span>Теги:</span><a class="js-tag-link" href="everything.html#product">Product</a><a class="js-tag-link" href="everything.html#design">Design</a></div></div>
