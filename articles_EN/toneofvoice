<h2>Tone of voice</h2><p>Our character and values find embodiment in words, intonation and the right combination of frankness, honesty and care. Tone of voice reflects our culture uniting all contact points from TV ads and social media posts to communication with a cashier or delivery driver.</p><h3>Intonation</h3><p>We avoid formal talks but keep a respectful distance. </p><p>At any contact point we are open and easy to understand. We are proud of our product but we don’t boast. Good quality speaks for itself. </p><p>We respect our customers and trust them.</p><p>We love jokes and we like laughing at ourselves because humour brings people together. But we always think ahead and try not to hurt feelings. </p><h3>Language</h3><p>Our language is the most simple and comprehensible. It can explain anything to anybody from a five-year old kid to an eighty-year old lady. We tend to simplify things, not complicated them. And we avoid extremes. We watch our language and treat customers with the most respect. We like using modern words if they help express the idea better but we never cross the line of familiarity or vulgarity. Neither in texts nor in visual design.</p><div class="table tone-table"><div class="tr table-header"><div class="td"><h6>Not Dodo</h6></div><div class="td"><h6>Dodo</h6></div></div><div class="tr"><div class="td"><h6 class="mobile">Not Dodo</h6><p>Dear Mr Ivanov!

Our tone and language let us meet this goal in the clearest manner. If we cannot describe it with our language, this goal is off our values.</p><p>Feedback is the best indicator of how the tone works. It’s a common truth that people tend to imitate the tone of those they like. If our customers start to imitate our language and tone, it means our communication is a success.</p><div class="article-footer"><div class="links"><span>Теги:</span><a class="js-tag-link" href="everything_EN.html#brand">Brand</a><a class="js-tag-link" href="everything_EN.html#language">Language</a></div></div>
